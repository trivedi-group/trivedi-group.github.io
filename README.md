# Biography

I received my BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Sciences and my PhD in biomarker discovery using metabolomics from Middlesex Univeristy.  I briefly trained at The London School of Tropical Medicine at post doctoral fellow, then worked at The University of Manchester with Prof Royston Goodacre and Prof Perdita Barran before starting independent research at UoM. 

# Interests

My research interests lies in application of chemometrics for clinical metabolomics and wearables for disease diagnostics. I combine my personal research interests in personalised medicine and biomarker discovery from bio-fluids. 

My group is currently working on rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis by using non-invasive wearable sampling and smell-led metabolomics analysis, collaborating with cross-continental clinical research teams. 

I am also collaborating on other projects within the University for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and creating a Chemometrics hub - stats for all, within MIB.
