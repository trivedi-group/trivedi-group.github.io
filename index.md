# About Trivedi group

Our research interests are applications of chemometrics in clinical metabolomics and development of wearables for disease diagnostics. The group is currently working on rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. We aim to develop non-invasive wearable sampling devices; smell-led metabolomics analysis pipelines and chemometrics tools for biomarker discovery. We currently collaborate with cross-continental clinical research teams in countries such as USA, Africa and India. 

Within the University the group collaborates for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and for creating a Chemometrics hub - stats for all, within MIB.
